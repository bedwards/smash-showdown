# Spatial Analysis

## Distance Matrix (Approximate)

Key locations and their relationships:

| From | To | Distance (studs) | Notes |
|------|-----|-----------------|-------|
| Spawn (0,0) | Frozen Peaks | ~500 | NW, uphill |
| Spawn (0,0) | Shadow Mtns | ~450 | NE, dangerous |
| Spawn (0,0) | Survivor Radio | ~150 | Close, safe music |
| Spawn (0,0) | Static FM | ~500 | North, creepy |
| Frozen Peaks | Shadow Mtns | ~600 | Mountain crossing |

## Zone Difficulty (Estimated by Distance from Spawn)

- **Safe Zone** (0-200 studs): Spawn area, Survivor Radio, initial resources
- **Medium Zone** (200-400 studs): Rivers, trading posts, some creatures
- **Danger Zone** (400+ studs): Mountains, Static FM, doom approaches

## Vertical Distribution

- **Ground Level**: Y = 0 (base terrain)
- **River Level**: Y = -1 to -2 (water beds)
- **Mountain Peaks**: Y = 200-400 (snow caps start ~200)
- **Radio Tower Lights**: Y = 60-100 (signal beacons)
